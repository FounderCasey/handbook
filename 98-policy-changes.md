# Policy Changes
*The only constant is change...*

We want all of our policies to be living documents which can improve and change as we learn and grow as a company. This is how we'll propose and make changes to our policies.

Right now, we use the following tools to discuss the Handbook:

1. **GitHub** - The canonical resource. Feel free to open a pull request with context!
2. **Slack** - Actually... we don't use Slack... yet?
3. **In Person Meetings** - Our hope is that as we grow and scale we'll have more opportunities to gather in-person and virtually to discuss the #handbook openly.
