# A Quick Introduction
*Mission, Values, Team, and Our (Developing) Story*

## Mission Statement

We believe in an exciting and inevitable future where everything that we do will be fundamentally touched and transformed by **bitcoin & blockchain technology** and the world will be an infinitely better place to live, work, and play.

Consequently, our mission is to accelerate the growth and adoption of bitcoin & blockchain through awareness, education, and entertainment.

## Our Values

Or the things we say around the office, a lot.

1. **Continuous Improvement** - 1%, everyday. Compounded, that's a lot of growth.
2. **Everything is an Experiment** - Experimentation assumes room for failure (but it's also how we win). [Learn faster](http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/sustainable-sources-of-competitive-advantage/).
3. **Steve Martin** - Be so good they can't ignore you.

According to myth and legend, our friend, The Yenicorn, was raised by a herd of Japanese unicorns in a mysterious other worldly… … world. She knows (as prophecy has foretold) that she has a very important part to play in the cryptocurrency community but is understandably a bit nervous and often lacks a bit of self-confidence (thus the helmet)  – but she wants to help people and do her very best!
