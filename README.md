# Our Company Handbook
*A Collaborative Handbook for Staff and Our Community*

Every company wants to build a healthy, dynamic, values-driven, and inclusive (add more fancy buzzwords here...) organizational culture but it's much easier said than done. And we understand as we know that most companies, especially early-stage ventures like ours, struggle with simply taking the time to write out and codify their beliefs and cultural values when there are 1,000 other things to be doing!

But we know, after having built a few companies previously, that the consistent effort is :100: worth it in the short and long-run. And by also making these documents open to the public and by encouraging our own team to collaborate on it allows us the opportunity and chance to minimize bias and exclusionary behavior while modeling our beliefs publicly in a way that will benefit everyone.

In short, we want to walk-the-walk and not just talk-the-talk when it comes to organizational health!

Consequently, this WIP ("Work in Progress") repository will contain most (but certaintly not all) of the current organizational policies that we use at Yen. It's not perfect just as the founders of Yen are not perfect. Rather, we want it to be an open dialogue and representation of who we are today and who we want to be in the future. It's the starting block rather than the finish line.

Feel free to use this repository for your own needs, fork it, share it, and even consider making a pull request if you see something that doesn't look right. We welcome all feedback and suggestions so the more the merrier!

Here's to making our company as good as the products we sell, if not better.

â€” John
