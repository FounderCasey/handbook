# Our Company Handbook
*A Collaborative Handbook for our Team & Community*

This `handbook` has gone through a number of changes over the years and this version is no exception! If anything, this version should be the most "usable" as there's only one page to review (and update... _*whew_)!

This repository serves a number of purposes:

1. Gives a high-level overview of who we are, what we do, and why we do what we do
2. Our compensation, benefits, and employment policies for our staff and team
3. A cultural glossary of practices, principles, and operating virtues
4. And anything else we might think of...

It's a work-in-progress, something designed to be touched by anyone in our community. I'm particularly interested in getting feedback from new community members as you all will see things that the current team may unintentionally (and intentionally) ignore! Please help us identify our blindspots and **question everything**—[kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen)!

I'm so grateful that you're here and that you've decided to commit a season of your life helping to build _meaningful_ and _impactful_ software for the YEN community! You're here because success isn't possible without you.

To infinity (and bitcoin).

John // Chief Cartridge Blower

## Operating Virtues

Ben Horowitz via his book [What You Do is Who You Are](https://amzn.to/338OBm7) helped us frame our own:

>Bushido looks like a set of principles, but it’s a set of practices. The samurai defined culture as a code of action, a system not of values but of virtues. A value is merely a belief, but a virtue is a belief that you actively pursue or embody. 
>
>The reason so many efforts to establish “corporate values” are basically worthless is that they emphasize beliefs instead of actions. Culturally, what you believe means nearly nothing. What you do is who you are.

Consequently, here are our current `operating virtues` (taken from our [blog](https://blog.yen.io/day-one/):


### 1. Table All The Things — `#tatt`
Or, in other words, we “put everything out on the table” — the good, the bad, and most definitely the ugly. Information is the lifeblood of our business which is especially true in a distributed-first organization. This means that we share things in real-time: We don’t wait for the timing to be “perfect” and we’re comfortable with sharing incomplete, imperfect, and unpolished prose. 

Consequently, this means that what we share is going to be, quite often, incomplete, imperfect, and in sore need of serious polishing — we treat all updates with respect, knowing of the courage required to share something that may make the person look foolish, silly, or even stupid. Instead, we engage graciously, responding to the update with the care and attention that we’d hope to receive if it was our own, knowing that they’ve successfully modeled this virtue with excellence.

Finally, #tatt means that we’ll often share things that are intensely personal and are only meant for those presently at our table. Everything shared in our communication tools should be held in the highest regard and with strict confidence.

Our table is strong when trust is the foundation.


### 2. Speed of Decision Making — `#sodm`
No bullshit: We are in a fight for our very survival and every single day we make life-altering decisions — sometimes, with very little data. Regardless, we agree with General Patton when he said “A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week.” 

That “plan”, by the way, is our first operating virtue, #tatt, because our team has mastered the art of communicating plainly the high-level context, the people involved, and the decision(s) that need to be made and by what time (and by whom). We clearly state if consensus or feedback is required and, with enough collective confidence that we can bear, we commit to the decision, even if we may personally disagree. We move the fastest when we are aligned, feelings aside.

Otherwise, you should #tatt, providing all the above data and informing the team of your decision with a request for specific people to keep you accountable — this simply means that you will do what you say you’ll do and you’re asking for support in keeping that commitment on track.

Prior to PinPT he was a co-founder of The Iron Yard which was acquired by Apollo Global (Fortune 500).

#### The Yenicorn - Mascot - [LinkedIn](https://yenicorn.com/about/)

According to myth and legend, our friend, The Yenicorn, was raised by a herd of Japanese unicorns in a mysterious other worldly… … world. She knows (as prophecy has foretold) that she has a very important part to play in the cryptocurrency community but is understandably a bit nervous and often lacks a bit of self-confidence (thus the helmet)  – but she wants to help people and do her very best!

## Our Story

It all started with a simple, personal challenge: [John](http://beta.yen.io/john) decided in 2016 that he would vlog [every single day](https://john.do/vlogger/) for an entire year. To make a very long story short, he managed to complete this personal challenge but not without soliciting the help of his brother, [Peter](http://beta.yen.io/peter), because he needed a bit of accountability, support, and encouragement to make it to the end.

Peter obliged and went on to build a number of YouTube channel experiments, [one of which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocfKj9RovK4) started growing like a weed and became the first step, of many, towards a much broader vision. It was immediately obvious that this could become much more than a fun side project and both Peter and John resigned (post [here](https://agilescout.com/time-for-change/) and [here](https://john.do/2017-review/)) from their full-time roles to pursue this incredibly exciting opportunity together.

Since the Summer of 2017 they have built [a handful](https://github.com/yenio/changelog/wiki/2.-Roadmap#where-weve-been-the-quick-hits) of websites, apps, and digital products with the explicit intent to research, analyze, and understand the larger blockchain and decentralized economy so that they might be able to serve the cryptocurrency community well. Not all of the products worked, but, a few of them did, which only bolstered their resolve to continue listening and building.

The culmination of their research and [co-building](https://github.com/yenio/changelog/wiki/3.-Our-CoBuilders) efforts with the larger community lead them down the path to create [YEN](http://yen.io) and they were gratefully joined by [Su](http://beta.yen.io/su) and [James](http://beta.yen.io/james) as well as a top-flight group of financial partners in early 2018.

A `Closed Beta` version of YEN was released on October 4 and the team hopes to release an `Open and Public` version in mid-2019.
