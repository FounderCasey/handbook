# Our Company Handbook
*A Collaborative Handbook for Team & Community*

Every company wants to build a healthy, dynamic, values-driven, and inclusive (add more fancy buzzwords here...) organizational culture but it's much easier said than done. And we understand as we know that most companies, especially early-stage ventures like ours, struggle with simply taking the time to write out and codify their beliefs and cultural values when there are 1,000 other things to be doing!

But we know, after having built a few companies previously, that the consistent effort is :100: worth it in the short and long-run. And by also making these documents open to the public and by encouraging our own team to collaborate on it allows us the opportunity and chance to minimize bias and exclusionary behavior while modeling our beliefs publicly in a way that will benefit everyone.

In short, we want to walk-the-walk and not just talk-the-talk when it comes to organizational health!

Consequently, this WIP ("Work in Progress") repository will contain most (but certainly not all) of the current organizational policies that we use at Yen. It's not perfect just as the founders of Yen and our growing team are not perfect. Rather, we want it to be an open dialogue and representation of who we are today and who we want to be in the future.

It's the starting block rather than the finish line.

Feel free to use this repository for your own needs, fork it, share it, and even consider making a pull request if you see something that doesn't look right. We welcome all feedback and suggestions so the more the merrier!

Here's to making our company as good as the products we sell, if not better.

## Work @ Yen

Here are some of the roles that we'd love to fill:

- Community & Social Media Manager

Early-stage blockchain & cryptocurrency company is looking for their first-ever community manager! This person deeply understands the power of online community and has the experience and expertise to build systems and programs (online and offline) to connect our mission with a large and growing audience. We imagine this person to be adept at social media tooling and technology and may have even built out their own frameworks and tools to accomplish high-engagement. They also understand (and are excited about) the dynamics, challenges, and opportunities working for an early-stage, venture-backed startup lead by experienced founders with multiple exits. You'll also be a part of the founding team which necessarily means that you'll work on a number of technical (development skills are not required, but useful!) and non-technical projects to help create additional momentum, including our existing social media properties and channels.
