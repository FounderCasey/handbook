# Our Company Handbook
*A Collaborative Handbook for our Team & Community*

This `handbook` has gone through a number of changes over the years and this version is no exception! If anything, this version should be the most "usable" as there's only one page to review (and update... _*whew_)!

This repository serves a number of purposes:

1. Gives a high-level overview of who we are, what we do, and why we do what we do
2. Our compensation, benefits, and employment policies for our staff and team
3. A cultural glossary of practices, principles, and operating virtues
4. And anything else we might think of...

Clearly, it's a work-in-progress and it's something that's designed to be touched by anyone and everyone in our community. I'm particularly interested in getting feedback from new community members as you all see things that the current team may unintentionally (and intentionally) ignore! Please help us identify our blindspots and **question everything**.

I'm so grateful that you're here and that you've decided to commit a season of your life helping to build _meaningful_ and _impactful_ software for the YEN community! You're here because success isn't possible without you.

To infinity (and bitcoin).
