## A Few Odds and Ends for Later

I'm capturing content and work around our project for later use.

**All of this is WIP (Work in Progress) and none of this represents any of our business or product atm!**

### What is the guideline/sniff test we'll use for every product/design decision?

The `how` may come in different forms and levels of detail, but we'll have a baseline **YEN Promise** we will adhere to in making decisions that impact our users.

Our basic promise that we’ll do our best to help you understand and have options around your data (that includes your info/content and others’ interactions with your info/content). We want to equip you to make the best decision for yourself in how you want to share and interact with YEN.

For all users, regardless of role/where you are on YEN:

Expression <> Control;  Greatest amount of freedom of expression weighed by greatest amount of control over your information

- Know where your information is going (in plain language)
- Know what information you are receiving (in plain language)
    - know when you are mentioned in a public space
    - know when there is engagement with your content
    - know how you are receiving the info you're receiving
    - know who can access what of your content/information
    - have relevant information at hand when making a decision
- Control where your information is going/what you are receiving
    - release of new features/information flow will by default come with options for you to decide who sees what
    
### A More `Narrative` Form

(*I wanted to write out how the promise would be felt and experienced.*)

We know what it's like to be "surprised" when an app that you love *suddenly* changes without any warning or notice — things aren't where they used to be, data and content seems to be lost, and the terrible sense and feeling that you might have to spend your day relearning how to use the software instead of getting your more important work done.

`Our Promise` to our community and each community member is that you will never experience that in YEN. What this means is that:

- We promise to give at least 2 business weeks (10 working days) of notice when something is going to be changing in the core experience (e.g. software patch, design update, etc).
- Any new feature that we add to the product will default to `OFF` so you'll never be surprised by a new and unexpected product experience. (options)
- We promise to do our best to help you understand what your options are around your data (your content and interactions by others with your content).
- mWe promise to have a group of educated individuals ready to help with any issues or questions you might have around a ~~new~~ ~~feature~~ your experience with YEN
- We promise to lean every decision into building and growing healthy communities
- We promise to do our utmost in being a pro team with a pro product represent YEN well.
