# Welcome to Yen
*This is just the beginning...*

Hey! Welcome to the Yen team, we’re so excited to have you with us! We’re hoping you’re going to learn a lot working here and that we’ll learn a lot from you. But first, this document will help you start figuring out how Yen works and how we work together.

To start, you're going to want to make sure you review [Our Mission and Values](https://github.com/yenio/handbook/blob/master/0-introduction.md#mission-statement) and we're sure you going to want to know all about the [Benefits & Perks](###). 

You'll probably have questions so feel free to ping anyone on the team, drop a note in Slack {**#OrgDev**) or if you need anything specific, ping John! Also, if you have comments and/or suggestions on this Handbook, please join #handbook in Slack and contribute!

2. [Your First Week](https://github.com/yenio/handbook/blob/master/1-onboarding.md#your-first-week)

#### Your First Day

At this point you should have been fully onboarded via Gusto (review [benefits](https://github.com/yenio/handbook/blob/master/2-benefits.md)) and you should provide your documents for the I-9 filing. If you are still having trouble, make sure to ping John via Slack asap! You should have also reviewed our [employment guidelines](https://github.com/yenio/handbook/blob/master/3-employment.md) which may feel like a review but is still important (and we'll continue to update it as our guidelines grow and improve)!

If you need any gear please ping one of the founders and we'll get it sorted! We want you to feel comfortable and have everything you need to be a success.

We currently use a number of different services to get our work done, including (but not limited to):

1. Google Apps for Email, Docs, and More
2. Slack for Communication
3. Gusto for Payroll and Health Benefits
4. GitHub for Development

It's possible that you've already been granted access but if you're missing something critical to your work then please make sure to get access today! The first day can be overwhelming so we want to make sure you have everything you need, especially the right tools, logins, and services.

Spend time saying "Hi" to your team via Slack or around the office. Join a few of the #channels while you're at it (but don't feel pressuerd to join all of them). We're still very small so you'll get to know everyone pretty quickly and **we believe that the entire team is responsible for successful onboarding** so we are **all** here to help and support you!

If we can, we'll go out to lunch - make sure we're aware of your food preferences and/or restrictions!

Remember, there's a lot of work to be done but it doesn't have to be completed on the first day! This is going to be great and we're so glad you've chosen to be part of the Yen story!

Finally, be on the lookout for possible "snail mail" to finalize any State or Federal requirements (we'll give you a heads-up, of course).

#### Your First Week

We want your first week to feel as comfortable as possible making sure that you have everything that you need to be successful. This most likely will include a handful of meetings with team and a ton of chatter via Slack, our current go-to communication system.

If you qualify for [Health Benefits](https://github.com/yenio/handbook/blob/master/2-benefits.md) then your enrollment period will start and you'll have only a few business days to make a decision - so sooner rather than later! Ping @John via Slack if you have any questions.

Also, you may feel inclined to share the news of Yen via social media and we'd love you to do that! We do not have any policies or rules around social media use, by the way - use good judgment and feel free to ask anyone on the team about posting content pre-tweet/pre-status-update if you'd like.

There are a few social networks that we're part of that we'd love for you to **follow** and even **add them** to your profiles! There is, of course, no pressure to do so.

1. Twitter: 
2. LinkedIn: 
5. Angel List:
7. #EngOps Newsletter:
8. Yen Blog:

On the last point, we'd love for you to contribute! We can give you publishing access to our blog and if you write something on your own blog (or Medium.com) we could reblog it as well! The more the merrier at this point!

Oh, and one final thing while we're on the topic of blogs... we've written consistently about how we started putting the company and the product together, [almost from Day #1](https://blog.pinpt.com/build-better-software/). This isn't *required* reading but it could certainly give you a lot of context for where we've been and what we've been dreaming about since the beginning. 

Might be fun to read how far we've come and it would certainly give you a deeper and wider perspective.
