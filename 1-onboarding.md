# Welcome to Yen
*This is just the beginning...*

Hey! Welcome to the Yen team, we’re so excited to have you with us! We’re hoping you’re going to learn a lot working here and that we’ll learn a lot from you. But first, this document will help you start figuring out how Yen works and how we work together.

To start, you're going to want to make sure you review [Our Mission and Values](https://github.com/yenio/handbook/blob/master/0-introduction.md#mission-statement) and we're sure you going to want to know all about the [Benefits & Perks](https://github.com/yenio/handbook/blob/master/2-benefits.md). 

You'll probably have questions so feel free to ping anyone on the team, drop a note in Slack {**#OrgDev**) or if you need anything specific, ping John! Also, if you have comments and/or suggestions on this Handbook, please join #handbook in Slack and contribute!

**Table of Contents**

1. [Your First Day](https://github.com/yenio/handbook/blob/master/1-onboarding.md#your-first-day)
2. [Your First Week](https://github.com/yenio/handbook/blob/master/1-onboarding.md#your-first-week)

#### Your First Day

At this point you should have been fully onboarded via Gusto (review [benefits](https://github.com/yenio/handbook/blob/master/2-benefits.md)) and you should provide your documents for the I-9 filing. If you are still having trouble, make sure to ping John asap! You should have also reviewed our [employment guidelines](https://github.com/yenio/handbook/blob/master/3-employment.md) which may feel like a review but is still important (and we'll continue to update it as our guidelines grow and improve)!

If you need any gear please ping one of the founders and we'll get it sorted! We want you to feel comfortable and have everything you need to be a success.

We currently use a number of different services to get our work done, including (but not limited to):

1. Google Apps for Email, Docs, and More
2. Dropbox for Files and Dropbox Paper for Internal Communique
3. Gusto for Payroll and Health Benefits
4. GitHub, JIRA, Confluence for Development and Product Management

It's possible that you've already been granted access but if you're missing something critical to your work then please make sure to get access today! The first day can be overwhelming so we want to make sure you have everything you need, especially the right tools, logins, and services.

Remember, there's a lot of work to be done but it doesn't have to be completed on the first day! This is going to be great and we're so glad you've chosen to be part of our story!

Finally, be on the lookout for possible "snail mail" to finalize any State or Federal requirements (we'll give you a heads-up, of course).

#### Your First Week

We want your first week to feel as comfortable as possible making sure that you have everything that you need to be successful. This most likely will include a few meetings with team and a walkthrough of how the business operates currently, especially as we're still very small.

If you qualify for [Health Benefits](https://github.com/yenio/handbook/blob/master/2-benefits.md) then your enrollment period will start and you'll have only a few business days to make a decision - so sooner rather than later! Ping @John via Slack if you have any questions.

Also, you may feel inclined to share the news of Yen via social media and we'd love you to do that! We do not have any policies or rules around social media use, by the way - use good judgment and you can always ask anyone on the team about posting publicly.

There are a few social networks that we're part of that we'd love for you to **follow** and even **add them** to your profiles! There is, of course, no pressure to do so.

1. Twitter: 
2. LinkedIn: 
3. Angel List:
4. Yen Blog: 

On the last point, we'd love for you to contribute! We can give you publishing access to our blog and if you write something on your own blog (or Medium.com) we could reblog it as well! The more the merrier at this point! John loves digital publishing so if you want any tips he'd be more than willing to share how to best get started!
